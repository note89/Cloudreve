This function is crucial for initializing various components of Cloudreve, including those related to different storage providers.\n\nThe Init function uses a slice of dependencies, each with a 'mode' and a 'factory' function. The 'mode' can be 'master', 'slave', or 'both', allowing Cloudreve to initialize components differently based on its operational mode.\n\nKey initializations related to storage providers include:\n- model.Init(): Sets up the database models, including those for different storage policies.\n- cache.Init(): Initializes the caching system, crucial for performance across various storage backends.\n- cluster.Init(): Prepares the system for distributed operations, relevant for cloud storage providers.\n- aria2.Init(): Sets up the download manager, which can interact with different storage backends.\n\nThis flexible initialization process allows Cloudreve to support multiple storage providers while maintaining a unified system architecture. As you review the code, notice how the initialization prepares the system to handle various storage scenarios efficiently.","file":"bootstrap/init.go","highlight":[{"start":22,"end":132}],"title":"","id":"413"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Let's look at the FileSystem struct in the filesystem package. This struct is central to Cloudreve's file management capabilities.","file":"pkg/filesystem/filesystem.go","highlight":[{"start":38,"end":64}],"title":"","id":"414"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Let's examine the Driver interface, a crucial component in Cloudreve's extensible architecture. This interface defines the methods that each storage provider must implement, enabling seamless integration of various storage backends.\n\nThe Driver interface acts as a contract between Cloudreve and different storage providers. By implementing this interface, new storage providers can be easily added to the system without modifying the core codebase. This design allows Cloudreve to support a wide range of storage options, from local storage to cloud-based solutions.\n\nKey methods in this interface include:\n- Put: For uploading files\n- Delete: For removing files\n- Get: For retrieving file content\n- Thumb: For handling thumbnails\n- Source: For generating download links\n- List: For listing files and directories\n\nEach of these methods corresponds to a core file operation, ensuring that all storage providers offer a consistent set of functionalities. This abstraction layer is what allows Cloudreve to offer a unified file management experience across different storage backends.","file":"pkg/filesystem/driver/handler.go","highlight":[{"start":17,"end":51}],"title":"","id":"415"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Let's examine the local Driver as an example of a storage provider implementation and compare it with other providers.\n\nThe local Driver is one of several storage backends supported by Cloudreve. It's designed for storing files on the local filesystem. Other providers include S3, OneDrive, and remote storage.\n\nKey differences between providers:\n1. Configuration: Local uses file paths, while cloud providers need API credentials.\n2. File operations: Local uses OS calls, cloud providers use API requests.\n3. Performance: Local is fast for small deployments, cloud scales better.\n4. Features: Cloud providers often offer CDN integration and global distribution.\n\nCloudreve's modular design allows easy addition of new storage backends by implementing the Driver interface we saw earlier. This flexibility is crucial for supporting diverse storage needs.","file":"pkg/filesystem/driver/local/handler.go","highlight":[{"start":28,"end":30}],"title":"","id":"416"},{"type":"highlight","description":"Now let's examine the Policy struct.
